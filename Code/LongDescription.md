## Description
This asset pack add specific industrial manufacturing buildings to produce goods in a boosted way having the production multiplier set to 6.
Also there are several Cargo Train Stations to get your trains transport specific kind of resources and goods.
Using CTRL+E by defaults will apply the settings of the Extractor Efficiency that can be configured in the Settings Option of the Menu. I will change this behaivor in future release.

## DISCLAIMER
* Safe to remove. This mod will not break your save if removed. However the assets will no longer work.
* This mod may require ***Asset Packs Manager*** which is highly experimental. This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors. Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save. But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage.
